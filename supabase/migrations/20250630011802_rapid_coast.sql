/*
  # Fix Image Loading Issues with Fallback Mechanism
  
  1. New Features
    - Add fallback mechanism for image loading
    - Ensure proper storage bucket configuration
    - Add validation function for photo URLs
    
  2. Benefits
    - Prevents "Image failed to load" errors
    - Improves reliability of photo display
    - Better error handling for storage operations
