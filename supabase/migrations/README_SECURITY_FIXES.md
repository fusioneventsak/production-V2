# Security Fixes for Supabase Views

## Issue Fixed: Security Definer Views

This migration addresses security advisor issues related to database views that were implicitly using `SECURITY DEFINER`. These views have been recreated with `SECURITY INVOKER` explicitly specified to ensure they respect row-level security policies.

### Views Fixed

1. `subscription_analytics`
2. `stripe_subscription_details`
3. `active_subscriptions_with_profiles`

## What Changed

- Added explicit `WITH (security_invoker = true)` to all affected views
- Preserved the exact same query logic and functionality
- Maintained all existing permissions and grants

## Why This Matters

Views created without explicitly specifying `SECURITY INVOKER` (the default) implicitly use `SECURITY DEFINER`, which can be a security risk. `SECURITY DEFINER` views execute with the permissions of the view creator rather than the querying user, potentially allowing users to bypass row-level security policies.

By explicitly setting `SECURITY INVOKER`, we ensure that:
- Row-level security policies are properly enforced
- Users can only access data they're authorized to see
- The principle of least privilege is maintained

## How to Apply

The migration file `20250818_fix_security_definer_views.sql` should be applied to your Supabase project using the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase db push
```

## Testing

A test script `test_security_invoker_views.sql` is provided to verify that the views still function correctly after the changes. Run this script after applying the migration to ensure everything works as expected.

## Impact on Application

These changes have no impact on application functionality. All queries that previously worked will continue to work exactly the same way, but with improved security.
